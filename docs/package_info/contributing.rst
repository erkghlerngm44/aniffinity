Contributing
============


In the unlikely event that someone finds this package, and in the even unlikelier
event that someone wants to contribute,
send me a `pull request <https://github.com/erkghlerngm44/malaffinity/pulls>`__
or create an `issue <https://github.com/erkghlerngm44/malaffinity/issues>`__.

.. note:: This isn't my main GitHub account, so `contact <contact>`__ me on Reddit if you do
          use those services, otherwise I probably won't see it for weeks/months.

That's it, uh, I guess...
