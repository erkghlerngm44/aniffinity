Introduction
============


What is this?
-------------

Aniffinity provides a simple way to calculate affinity (Pearson's correlation * 100)
between a "base" user and another user on anime list services.

..  note::
    The term "base user" refers to the user whose scores other users' scores
    will be compared to (and affinities to said scores calculated for).

    Just assume the "base user" is referring to you, or whoever will be running
    your script, unless you're getting into some advanced mumbo-jumbo,
    in which case you're on your own.

For a list of anime list services that can be used with Aniffinity, see
:ref:`available-services`.

Aniffinity is meant to be used in bulk, where one user (the "base")'s scores are compared
against multiple people, but there's nothing stopping you from using this as a one-off.
