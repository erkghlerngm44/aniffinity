Available Services
------------------

The following anime list services can be used with Aniffinity:

* `Anilist <https://anilist.co>`__

  * **Aliases**: ``AL``, ``A``

* `Kitsu <https://kitsu.io>`__

  * **Aliases**: ``K``

..  note::
    Do note, this package is designed for cross-service compatibility.
    You are able to, say, calculate affinity (or compare scores) with
    one user on AniList and another on Kitsu, for example.

    There's nothing restricting you to stick with users from one
    service, unless that's your intention.
