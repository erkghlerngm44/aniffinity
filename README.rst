malaffinity
===========

Calculate affinity between MyAnimeList users

What is this?
-------------

Calculate the affinity (Pearson's Correlation \* 100) between a "base"
user and another user.

This script is meant to be used in bulk, where one user (the "base")'s
scores are compared against multiple people, but there's nothing
stopping you from using this as a one-off.

**In all files here, the "base" user refers to the user whose scores
other scores will be compared to (and affinities to said scores
calculated for). I don't have a better name to describe this, so please
bear with me.**

**In most cases, just assume that the "base" user is referring to you,
or the person who will be running your script**

Install
-------

::

    $ pip install malaffinity

Alternatively, download this repo and run:

::

    $ python setup.py install

Or copypasta the ``malaffinity`` directory to
Python:raw-latex:`\site`-packages and install the
`dependencies <#dependencies>`__ yourself.

Dependencies
------------

-  BeautifulSoup4
-  lxml
-  Requests

These should be installed when you install this script, so no need to
worry about them.

Usage
-----

1. Create an instance of the ``MALAffinity`` class, providing the param
   ``base_user``, and an optional ``round`` to it.

   -  The ``base_user`` is the username whose scores other scores will
      be compared to.
   -  Rounding of the final affinity is determined by the ``round``
      param. To round results, provide a number of decimal places to
      round to. For no rounding, specify ``False``
   -  *Note that the class can be initialised without the ``base_user``
      param, but a ``base_user`` **MUST** be passed to the ``init``
      function before any affinity calculations take place. (See
      `example 2 <#example-2>`__)*

2. Calculate affinity between the "base user" and another user by
   calling the ``calculate_affinity`` method with the username of the
   person you wish to calculate affinity with.

   -  This will return a tuple, containing the affinity, and the number
      of shared rated anime.

3. Calculate more affinities by repeating Step 2.

Examples
--------

Using ``ma`` as the name of the initialised class, because I can't think
of a better name that won't shadow anything that already/will exist(s).

Example 1
~~~~~~~~~

**Basic usage**

.. code:: python

    ma = MALAffinity("YOUR_USERNAME")

    affinity, shared = ma.calculate_affinity("OTHER_USERNAME")

    print(affinity)
    # 79.00545465639877
    print(shared)
    # 82

Example 2
~~~~~~~~~

**Basic usage, but specifying a "base user" AFTER initialising the
class**

.. code:: python

    ma = MALAffinity()

    # This can be done anywhere as long as the place you're doing this from has access to `ma`.
    ma.init("YOUR_USERNAME")

    affinity, shared = ma.calculate_affinity("OTHER_USERNAME")

    print(affinity)
    # 79.00545465639877
    print(shared)
    # 82

Example 3
~~~~~~~~~

**Round affinities to two decimal places**

.. code:: python

    ma = MALAffinity("YOUR_USERNAME", round=2)

    affinity, shared = ma.calculate_affinity("OTHER_USERNAME")

    print(affinity)
    # 79.01
    print(shared)
    # 82

Example 4
~~~~~~~~~

**One-off affinity calculations**

Note that the ``calculate_affinity`` function is being used here - not
the method.

.. code:: python

    affinity, shared = calculate_affinity("YOUR_USERNAME", "OTHER_USERNAME")

    print(affinity)
    # 79.00545465639877
    print(shared)
    # 82

*Don't use this if you're planning on calculating affinity again with
one of the users you've specified when doing this. It's better to create
an instance of the ``MALAffinity`` class with said user, and calculating
affinity with the other user(s) that way. That instance will hold said
users' scores, so they won't have to be retrieved again. See examples
1-3*

Handling exceptions
-------------------

**NOTE:** As of v2.0.0, these exceptions are now contained in the
``exceptions`` file. Make sure to reference them properly if you'll be
going down this path. (``malaffinity.exceptions.ExceptionName``).

Three types of exceptions can be raised while calculating affinities:

-  ``NoAffinityError``: Raised when either the shared rated anime
   between the base user and another user is less than 10, or the other
   user does not have any rated anime.
-  ``InvalidUsernameError``: Raised when username specified does not
   exist.
-  ``MALRateLimitExceededError``: Raised when MAL's blocking your
   request, because you're going over their rate limit of one request
   every two seconds. Slow down and try again.

Not much you can do about the first two, so you're best off giving up if
you run into one of those. The third, however, rarely happens if you
abide by the rate limit, but the following should happen in case it
does:

-  Halt the script for a few seconds. I recommend five.
-  Try again.
-  If you get roadblocked again, just give up. MAL obviously hates you.

This can be achieved something along these lines:

.. code:: python

    success = False

    # Two attempts, then give up. Max tries can be adjusted here.
    for _ in range(2):
        try:
            affinity, shared = ma.calculate_affinity("OTHER_USERNAME")

        except malaffinity.exceptions.MALRateLimitExceededError:
            time.sleep(5)
            
        # Yes, this is too broad, but there's no point in typing out all the exceptions.
        except:
            # Hop over to the next person.
            # You'll want to stop doing anything with this person and move onto the next,
            # so use the statement that'll best accomplish this, given the layout of your script.
            return

        # Success!
        else:
            success = True
            break
        
    if not success:
        # See the note under `except:`. Same applies here
        return

I'm thinking about hardcoding the rate limit handling in, but I'm
worried about handling cases where MAL keeps blocking you - I don't want
to run into infinite loops. I'll look into this one day.

Feel free to use a loop though. Don't blame me if anything bad happens
because of it.
