    The MALAffinity class.

    The purpose of this class is to store a "base user"'s scores, so
    affinity with other users can be calculated easily.

    For the user ``Xinil``, the class can be initialised as follows:

    .. code-block:: python

        from malaffinity import MALAffinity

        ma = MALAffinity("Xinil")

    The instance, stored in ``ma``, will now hold ``Xinil``'s scores.

    :meth:`.comparison` and :meth:`.calculate_affinity` can now be called,
    to perform operations on this data.
    """

        """
        Initialise an instance of `MALAffinity`.

        .. note:: To avoid dealing with dodgy globals, this class MAY
                  be initialised without the ``base_user`` argument,
                  in the global scope (if you wish), but :meth:`.init`
                  MUST be called sometime afterwards, with a ``base_user``
                  passed, before affinity calculations take place.

                  Example (for the user ``Xinil``):

                  .. code-block:: python

                      from malaffinity import MALAffinity

                      ma = MALAffinity()

                      ma.init("Xinil")

                  The class should then be good to go.
